The Dynamic GUI

This is a demonstartion of a Windows .NET form that has GUI elements
procedurally generated.

Creating forms in this way requires an understanding of creating and
setting the properties of form controlls without the use of the WYSIWYG
editor in Windows, which is sometimes necessary for an application.
